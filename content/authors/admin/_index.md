My name is Avijit Chatterjee. I’m from India, currently living in United States. I'm a functional and reactive programing enthusiast and keen on learning new technologies with 15 years of experience.<br>
While I’m always getting better at what I do, I’ll will never get there which means there’s always more to learn. My experience has been mostly on the Java stack though I’m branching out into other technologies. Domain wise I'm most proficient in the Insurance sphere having worked at multiple Fortune 500 Insurance enterprises over the years.

I love to mentor people into better technical skills and to coach development teams into higher productivity.<br>
This idea of writing a technical blog came to mind during the COVID times when we were all locked up and there was plenty of time to kill. Thought this could be good place to pen down some of my tech learnings to help me keep track. Also hope these might help others get started maybe.

When I’m not at a computer or spending time with my family, I prefer to be outside. <br>
:bicyclist: is something I :heart:
