### Overview

Containerization can be defined as virtualization at the operating system (OS) level to allow deploying and running of distributed applications without the need for entire virtual machines (VMs) per application. This is economical in terms of computing resources since multiple isolated applications can run on a single host. Containerization became popular among development teams because containerized applications always run the same way regardless of host infrastructure.
